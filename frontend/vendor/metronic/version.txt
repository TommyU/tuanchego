metronic_version:3.6.3

To upgrade:
- Look at upgrade notes in the metronic template
- We only use layout 4 so you only need to overwrite those files in:
    - assets/admin/layout4/
    - sass/admin/layout4/
    - templates/admin4/

- We have a few customizations which couldn't be done in custom files, check if these should be reapplied:
    * In layout.js: function initSidebar: line 439 and 447: commented out the function of handleFixedSidebar
        ? This functions hides the blue 'active menu item' lines
        ? It stretches the menu across the entire page (which we don't want)
    * Metronic/assets/global/plugins/jquery-slimscroll/jquery.slimscroll.js: line 330, 422 & 423:
        ? When clicking on a link in a slimscroll container entire page was blocked
        ? This was because slimscroll was bound on the window object not on the DOM container
        ? For more information see pull request 198 on the github repo
